# SpotLit-Front End

Hello and Welcome Developers,
As you may know, SpotLit is a web application created to find good music using the Spotify API and created with Python Spotipy Library and Flask Microframework.

On the Front End side of things, we decided to use bootstrap and mimic what an app on your phone would look like on a browser. Right now, you can contribute along with us to create a suitable web app design that fits SpotLit's goal and balance in terms of UI and UX all together.

## Get Started!

First you need to clone this Github Repository

```bash
~ git clone https://github.com/abhishtagatya/spotlit-frontend
```
Then make sure you go to the directory and install the requirements using [pip]('https://pypi.org') and [Python3]('https://python.org')

```bash
~ cd spotlit-frontend
~ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Requiremts are all set and done. Now just start the project using Python3

```bash
~ python3 app.py
```

Open up your browser and enter

```bash
localhost:8000
```

## Design Goals

Our goal is simple in the Front End side. That is too mimic the aesthetics of a phone application that works on most browsers and still contain the easiness of use for users.

We can achieve this by balancing the two key component of an application and that is the User Interface and the User Experience.

## What We Want To Achieve

- [x] Fast to load content
- [x] Works well on both phone and desktop
- [x] Fluid and Responsive Web Design
- [ ] Improve User Experience on iPhone
- [ ] Improve User Experience on Android
- [ ] Works on all browsers (old and new possibly)
